# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

> My biggest time management challenge during Phase 0 will likely be being present in the moment. At times I’ll get so caught up on a certain aspect of a challenge or project that I lose sight of the overall goal. Then, before I know it, I’ve spent hours on what should be minor details. This likely has to do with being a perfectionist and wanting things to be “right”. 

* How will you combat that? 

> One way I hope to combat that challenge is to learn to be more present in the moment and aware of what I’m doing. I think by being aware and present will help me identify those triggers that take me off on time consuming tangents. As I improve in that identification, I’ll also be conscious of the choice to follow that tangent or not. 

* What techniques will you try?

> The techniques I’ll be using will include meditation. I would also like to include the practice of yoga. Coupled with the meditation, I believe they will aid in my self awareness and presentness as well as providing many other physical and mental benefits. 

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

> My overall plan for Phase 0 is to get it done. I was excited about the concept of tiny habits and over the next week will be looking for trigger opportunities that I can use to map a new tiny habit of meditation onto for a few minutes.
