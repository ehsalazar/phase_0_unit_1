# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

> I’m still trying to get my head wrapped around web standards. I understand what they are in principle but not sure if I do in practice. 

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

> If I’m understanding correctly, they basically set a level or standard stage for your webpage. This is of benefit since we as developers don’t always know how the website we are building will be accessed.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

> Everything we’ve done in HTML has so far made sense although we haven't gotten into anything too complex. The addition of HTML5 elements makes what we’ve done so far so much simpler and easier to follow. 

* Why is reset.css necessary?

> At first, the reset.css completely through me. I understood that it was what would set the web page inline with web standards but when I applied it to the index.html I didn’t like the outcome. It changed some of the scaling and position of things. It wasn’t until hours later, that I discovered that the order in which you link the .css files makes a difference. Once I realized that, I was good to go.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

> I’ve used Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and Safari. Currently I’m using mainly Chrome with some backup Safari. I do notice a difference in the ways websites are rendered. I’d say that on one hand, it’s good in that one type might be faster and easier to use. On the other hand however, from a developer prospective, I could imaging it could be challenging to think about how each might impact your desired outcome or output. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

> One tool that I used was actually provided in the June Rockets Google Community by another cohort. It was specifically about :hover and all the ways in which that pseudo selector could be used. Another page that I can across and bookmarked was from Wikipedia. It was actually about Crayola colors but it gave a clear representation on many popular colors as well as their hex code.

> I wish I could say today was easier than yesterday but it wasn’t. I continued to struggle with wrapping my head around the concepts presented. Things didn't look like I thought they would and when I couldn't initially figure out why, I became frustrated. 

> I took a break, and a long walk in the afternoon sun and came back refreshed. Suddenly everything that I was working at with the practice downloads was making sense…and working! It was great feeling it all click, even if that click came later in the day after hours of trying. 

> I feel confident in this particular challenges Learning Competencies. While much of today’s work was focused on editing practice HTML and CSS files, I’m happy with the outcome and looking forward to applying these concepts to our own site over the next couple of days.
