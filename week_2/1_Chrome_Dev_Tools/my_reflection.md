# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

> The DOM is a platform or tool that allows the user or developer to manipulate and create a website dynamically rather than statically. It’s an interface rather than a particular language. It looks at a website as a document build out of objects. It sets up a structure in where those objects then relate and interact with each other. Utilizing coding languages within this environment allows for the use of events, properties and methods.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

> The most noticeable difference when comparing our just build website to a blog on wordpress.com is in the level of advancement. While my site was static and isolated by page, the blogs were built dynamically with not only HTML and CSS but usually JavaScript as well. The blogs also allowed for more interaction from the read, through comment boards, sharing tools and continuity of flow.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

> I’ve accessed the Dev Tools before and do find them useful. I would say that I currently have a base understanding of what I’m doing or looking at within the tool environment. That said, there are still aspects that I’m at a loss over. As we’re exposed to and learn more advanced forms of the languages we’ve used as well as tying in JavaScript, I’m sure those gaps will lessen.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

> While I’ve access Dev Tools before, it had been to identify established HTML and CSS specifications. I hadn’t used them more dynamically to alter a sites state. I also learned that those changes can even be saved from within the platform.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

> I utilized the resources provided within the challenge with the addition of Google. Specifically, I was interested in why some of the CSS had been lined through. I now understand it had been overwritten by some other CSS elsewhere. 

> Perhaps it was because it was Monday or maybe because the dense nature of learning about the DOM, but I felt I struggled a bit more on the challenge. I found myself needing to take a break and regroup my thoughts on more than one occasion. 

> Another road block per se was in not yet understanding fully the advanced CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript that I was seeing within the Dev Tools. While some made sense, other parts did not and I wanted it all to be clear…now. That said, I did pick up a couple of new items or tricks apart from the challenge, for example taking a screenshot within an application rather than full screen or crosshairs. I also continued to deepen my comfort with git and Github.
