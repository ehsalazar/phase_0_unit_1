# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://ehsalazar.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

> Simpler is often times better. With built in negative space and a flow path in mind, your site can become more function and enjoyable for the user. You can also make a big impact with the right color palette and font choices. 

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

> I enjoy the design and user experience. I liked being able to look at my site from different perspectives and then build a plan for how I wanted to achieve a new overall look. This was different than my first attempt which was more adding as I went rather than having a plan to follow.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

> I found having the wireframe to be helpful. It made sense to create a blueprint before beginning to build. In the end I change only a few minor elements from the initial wireframe. For now, I centered my navigation bar and also flipped my blog/projects menu and content areas. 

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

> I worked on the responsive design and liked how I was able to adjust as the screen changed, That said, there is still much more I can learn in this area. Also, I would like to be able to add more flow to the site. Being able to add scrolling of elements like the blog rather than individual static pages. As considering adding tagging to blog posts and eventually search. 

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

> It wasn't so much difficult to implement but rather to control. Some elements would be started and before I knew it I had worked hours on it continually changing and adjust. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

> I made good use of the color sites, icon sites and Google fonts. I didnâ€™t really explore Initializr at all and want to. 

> Overall I enjoyed this solo challenge. I think I was already ahead of the crib as I had previously fleshed out the index last week. While it basic, I had already begun to consider its overall look. I feel comfortable with the Learning Competencies and enjoyed digging in.

> The only blocks or challenges I encountered with this challenge was where to stop. I know the our site will be an evolving piece to our Phase 0 work but I kept going back to it to fine tune it.
