# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

> Responsive web design is in essence, building your website with tools that aid in the flow and rendering of that website with its access point in mind. Simply put, we want our websites to be accessible and functional regardless of being accessed on a large desktop monitor, a notebook or tablet or even smartphone. It’s not only beneficial to the user accessing the site but also to the developer who can create one site that responds rather than building separate sites for each screen size. 

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

> As technology continues to advance I believe we will only increase the number of access calls from mobile devices. As more and more people continue to access their favorite sites from mobile devices, we as developers will have to continue to ensure that our designs and products are reachable. This will likely continue to expand in more ways as the internet of things expands. While we consider mobile devices today, tomorrow we will likely have to also consider wearable devices as well as other emerging technologies. 

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

> Handicap accessibility was something I hadn't really considered. It makes sense to create and design your product with the most end users in mind. We should make any adjustments we can to ensure sensory impaired users have options. 

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

> When we were first building our site, one of the disappointments I had was in not knowing how to utilize responsive design. As I wanted to share what I build last week with friends outside of Dev Bootcamp, I had to add an addendum that my site would best be viewed on their laptop or home computers. I know have a bit more insight in how to design with more access points in mind. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

> I found most of this challenges learning occurred with the help of the Girl Develop It slide tutorials and downloadable practice projects. 

> The aha moments that came yesterday with the Girl Develop It tools made my outlook on today’s challenge more hopeful. It was easier to gain the understanding and to put it into practice.
