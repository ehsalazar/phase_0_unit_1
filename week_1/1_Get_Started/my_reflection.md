## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

The process of setting up git and Github were fairly simple. That said, one issue I encountered was not being sure if the SSH key and/or credential.osxkeychain processed successfully. I'm also not confident if a pathway was created between the local git and the remote Github. The learning gained was in continued use of and comfort with the Command Line.

On a base level, git is a program that runs on the local computer. It allows a user to work on files with version control. Version control is the process in which a "snapshot" of the files is taken to remember changes made and when they were done. It also allows for collaboration between users. Since a "snapshot" of the entire file is taken, individual users can work on separate components or branches without effecting the master or trunk. Once the branches are complete, they can be merged into a new complete trunk or file. 

This collaborative process is amplified by the use of Github. In contrast to git, Github is a remote online hub where users can share their local files or repositories either publicly or privately. The real benefit to Github is in its social nature. That collaboration that can be accessed online by users regardless of location.

It makes sense that Developers utilize version control programs like git since it allows for compartmentalization of tasks or files for building larger programs, writing and refactoring code, and debugging. In reality, version control and online hosts like Github make sense not only for Developers but for anyone wanting to build projects in a step by step method and with options for collaboration from multiple partners.
