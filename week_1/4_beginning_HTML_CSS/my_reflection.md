## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

HTML and CSS were the first languages I was exposed to. Within the realm of online tutorials, both seemed simple and easy to understand. This was my first opportunity to actually put them into practice. While the concepts remained easy to understand, I found myself much more challenged. 

On one hand, you have what seems like an abundance of options as to what to add to a website and then how to style it. On the other hand, that can be come daunting and overwhelming.

There were points in the challenge that I wanted to add more and more then edit more and more. It was almost if there were too many option so rather than choosing, I was drawn to nothing. In the end, while I opted for a simple project, it helped in solidifying the steps and process. I'm sure as I learn more I can balance the design with better skill and execution. 

Apart from the resources listed in the challenge, I found myself returning to Codecademy's HTML & CSS track. This was likely due to familiarity as this was my first exposure to these concepts.
