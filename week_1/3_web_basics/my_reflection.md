## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I started with an understanding of the differences in internet and web and the differences in website and web applications. I gained better understanding of domain names and their hierarchy. I was unfamiliar with DNS and was able to gain some understanding of its background and importance.

There is much to consider when creating a HTML site. At the root, you have to decide if it will be static, such as a website or rather dynamic and interactive such as a web app. That decision will lead you to which programs and languages might be needed to build it. Hosting and domain names will need to be considered as well. From a front end perspective, you also have to consider things like the user experience and information architecture.

Although the websites we are building are primitive at this point, it was cool to see it go live and makes me want to dive further into HTML and CSS. I'm finding the skillcrush postings a new and valuable source. I'll likely re-audit the Codecademy tracks for HTML & CSS as well as JavaScript to have a more well rounded understanding heading into the next few lessons from Unit 1.

This section also presented the opportunity to utilize our local computers and git rather than Github online. While online adds and commits were simple, it's proving to be equally accessible locally. Apart from the directed add of an index file, I also changed the directory location.
