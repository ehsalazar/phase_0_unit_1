* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I felt like my dbc1.html challenge was pretty week, at least design wise. I put more time into this challenge and am happier with the results. While I'm understanding the main concepts of both HTML and CSS, I did have trouble with margins and padding. I stayed up most the night working on the challenge trying to get it adjusted. Again, while I'm pleased with the results, I will continue to work with positioning to further that understanding. 

I continued to use the resources provided in the challenge coupled with Codecademy. I was able to get it almost all done using those sources. Perhaps the only exception was in needing to Google how to set a wallpaper or image spanning the entire background. 

I continue to be excited by the design aspects of the challenge. I again felt myself drifting toward a downward OCD spiral in trying to get things "right" and tried to lean more on learning the concepts as opposed to perfection. I'm looking forward to the next challenge in wireframing as I think it will further my design interests.
