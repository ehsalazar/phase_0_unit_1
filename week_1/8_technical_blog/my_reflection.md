Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I liked the challenge as it had me giving greater consideration to sites I look at frequently. I began to notice more detail and the importance of certain design aspects of the pages. I also appreciated more about good and sometimes bad layout and accessibility. 

I really got into the set up of the blog templates and wanted them to align with my index and about me files. I looked for ways to build a unified and concise project. I even went as far as looking at ways to build out my index file or homepage. Once that was established, the implementation was rather struggle free. The only minor hiccup on the blog html was cured by Googling a bit about unicode and how to use apostrophes in my writing. 

As for the actual writing or blogging, it was a bit more challenging. I’ve considered blogging in the past but never took it up. Only recently have I begun to use an application for journaling. I would find myself asking if what I was sharing was relevant or of some importance. I became more aware of wording and not wanting to waste the readers time or effort.
