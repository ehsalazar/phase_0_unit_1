## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

A repository can be created on Github by logging into the site. Once on the profile page, selecting "New" from the "Repositories" tab. We used Github Pages to help set it up making sure to create the new repository with our correct username and making it public. We also initialized the repo with a README and a MIT License. Once the repo was created we had to clone it to our local computers. This can be accomplished through the command line or more simply through the Github app if it's been installed. Once the app is opened, you simply navigate to the username on the right bar. This will display all the repos that have been created on Github. When the correct repo is identified, select Clone to Computer. Finally select where you want your repo to be saved and you're in business. 

Open source is in essence putting what you've created out to the world for it's use and consumption. Not only the result or output of a particular program or project but also the code or tools used to generate the output. This process can sound both scary and exciting. On one hand, you may feel like you might lose control over something you created and feel ownership towards. On the other hand, it opens what you created up for collaboration which may lead to advances and refinement. A license can be utilized as sort of a stop measure to help address the first concern. The license is there to identify the project as open to use, modification and sharing but while also being there to help the creator.

This challenge continued to solidify the comfort and familiarity of Github. It was relatively easy to fork a repository from someone else, make changes and commit via the website as well as create a new repository of our own. I'm looking forward to being able to do all those things and more from my local computer with git as the driving tool as opposed to Github.
