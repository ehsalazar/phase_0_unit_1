Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

I've not read any other responses regarding fears so I'll just speak of my own. I know I was very excited to start DBC but also freaked out. While this was something I've wanted to do for many years, I just never had. The decision at the end of 2013 to leave a successful career and start a new one from the ground up was a hard one. To be honest, the first three months of this year were a haze of depression and angst. Somehow through that fog, I managed to force myself online everyday to do tutorials on multiple coding languages and computer science.

I had first heard of DBC last summer. That was likely the start of my thinking about the possibility of doing this. Finally in the first week of April I applied and after a whirlwind couple of weeks, here I am. Despite learning what I thought was a good amount on my own, I still entered into Phase 0 apprehensive and insecure about my abilities. I knew there would be some stuff I wouldn't know. I also believed there would be a good amount I didn't even know I didn't know. I also knew once I entered into the program that I would be in a new mix of people of varying backgrounds and talents. I wasn't sure how I would adjust to being in a setting where I might possibly be behind others who were often decades younger. 

I have two main take aways from Phase 0, Week 1. First, I need to take it one step at a time, if for nothing else, my mental health. When we received our Prep materials prior to Phase 0, I was completely overwhelmed when I first looked at the 20 exercises to complete. Then when we received our Phase 0, Week 1 curriculum, I once again was overwhelmed. It ALL sounded so foreign to me and I didn't think I would get past the very first week. As with the Prep work and now week 1, I just took it one step or exercise or challenge at a time. Before I knew it, I was practically done and felt I had learned some stuff. The second take away was around my insecurity on my level of programing knowledge coming into this. Yes there are some who know TONS more but there sounds to be a few who are even further behind me. At the end of the day I have to remind myself I'm not in competition with anyone but myself.
