Name: Ernie Salazar

Location: San Francisco, CA

Favorite Websites: Most visited are web apps like Twitter & Tumblr. I wanted to go with more 

static websites for the wireframing and technical blog.

	* http://fivethirtyeight.com/ A newer news outlet that’s heavily data drive. Charts and graphs made 

	interesting.

	* https://www.drbronner.com/ An e.comm site for a product I love. It’s totally hippie soap but I find 

	the site engaging and informative even if I buy the product locally rather than online.

	* http://www.fancy.com/ Think curated shopping. A place to discover and buy unique things.

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.
