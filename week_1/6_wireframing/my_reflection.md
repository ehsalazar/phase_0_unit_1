## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

While I've had a design background and education, it had been years since I was submerged in that work. It was refreshing and educational to learn about Design Thinking. It makes a world of difference in the ways I approach layout and design. I struggled in the previous two challenges as I was working more from a scientific theory. I would analyzed and experiment on one thing and it would lead to ten more things for me to obsess about. It made many more headaches as I tried to add elements and design to the pages I was building.

I like design and aesthetic and being able to communicate and engage beyond the use of words. It gives me much more consideration as I look at user experience. Wireframing felt very familiar as I've previously worked with blueprints and storyboards. Again, it was a tool I hadn't used in years but seemed so clear once reintroduced. 

I feel confident in the Learning Competencies for this challenge. The only set back was in narrowing down three websites or pages to focus on. I realized that many of my favorite websites are in fact web applications. While I visit Twitter, Facebook, Mint or something similar daily, I wanted to use more static websites for the wireframe challenge. It helped make clear more of the concepts. I enjoyed comparing the wireframe to the actual page. Once all the noise is removed, you see things clearer and sometimes differently.
